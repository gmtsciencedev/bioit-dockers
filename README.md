This is a serie of docker images we were unable to find elsewhere.

They are built on top of micromamba (https://github.com/mamba-org/micromamba-docker) and owe much to that effort.

They are minimalist by design and can be either used as they are or serve as an inspiration source. 

As for now, only a limited number of dockers will be build to serve as scitq examples.

They are published on Docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/gmtscience
